## Essential Angular CLI Commands for Effective Project Management 

The Angular CLI offers a powerful suite of commands to manage your Angular projects without using standalone components. This ensures adherence to the standard `NgModule` structure, making it easier to maintain modularity and scalability.
1. **Create a New Angular Project** 

To initiate a new Angular project, use the following command:



```bash
ng new my-angular-project
```


This will prompt you to configure key project settings such as routing, styles (CSS, SCSS, etc.), and others, allowing you to tailor the project setup.

2. **Generate a New Component** 
To generate a new component within your project, which will automatically be added to the closest `NgModule`, run:


```bash
ng generate component component-name --no-standalone
```


Or use the shorthand:



```bash
ng g c component-name
```

This will create the necessary component files (`.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.spec.ts`) and register it in the nearest `@NgModule` under the `declarations` array.
3. **Generate a New Service** 

For services that manage data or business logic, use:



```bash
ng generate service service-name
```


Or the shorthand:



```bash
ng g s service-name
```

This will create a service with a `.ts` file. By default, the service will be provided in the root module or component where it is injected.
4. **Generate a New Module** 

Modules help group related components, directives, pipes, and other elements. To generate a new module, run:



```bash
ng generate module module-name
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g m module-name
```


This will create the module file and add it to the nearest parent module. You can also specify a custom path if required.

5. **Generate a New Directive** 

Directives are used to add behavior to DOM elements. To generate a new directive, use:



```bash
ng generate directive directive-name --no-standalone
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g d directive-name
```

This creates the directive file and adds it to the `declarations` array of the relevant `NgModule`.
6. **Generate a New Pipe** 

Pipes are used for transforming data in templates. To create a new pipe, use:



```bash
ng generate pipe pipe-name --no-standalone
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g p pipe-name
```

This generates a pipe file, ensuring it is added to the `declarations` array of the corresponding `NgModule`.
7. **Generate a New Class** 

For utility classes, models, or other business logic files, use:



```bash
ng generate class class-name
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g cl class-name
```


This will generate the specified class file.

8. **Generate a New Interface** 

To generate an interface for type-checking and defining the structure of objects, use:



```bash
ng generate interface interface-name
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g i interface-name
```


This will create an interface file to define custom types within your application.

9. **Generate a New Enum** 

Enums are useful for defining a set of constants. To create a new enum, use:



```bash
ng generate enum enum-name
```


Or shorthand:



```bash
ng g e enum-name
```


This will create the enum file, which can then be used to group related values within the application.

10. **Serve the Project Locally** 

To launch the Angular development server and view your application in the browser, use:



```bash
ng serve
```

By default, this will serve the application at `http://localhost:4200/`. You can change the port by adding the `--port` flag:


```bash
ng serve --port 4500
```

11. **Build the Project for Production** 

To build the Angular project for production (minifying and optimizing the code), run:



```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will create a `dist/` folder containing the production-ready build, ready for deployment.
12. **Update the Project** 

To keep your Angular project up to date, use:



```bash
ng update
```


This command will check for available updates to Angular packages and apply them to your project.

13. **Run Unit Tests** 

To run unit tests using Karma and see results in the terminal, use:



```bash
ng test
```


This will run all the unit tests for your application.

14. **Run End-to-End Tests** 

To execute end-to-end tests with Protractor, use:



```bash
ng e2e
```


This will simulate user interactions to ensure the overall app functions as expected.

15. **Linting the Project** 
To check your project for linting errors (based on the rules defined in `tslint.json`), use:


```bash
ng lint
```


This will scan your project files for style and syntax issues according to the defined linting configuration.

16. **Add Dependencies** 

To install and configure new libraries or dependencies in your project, use:



```bash
ng add package-name
```


This will install the package and automatically update your Angular project configuration, for example, adding Angular Material or Progressive Web App (PWA) support.

17. **Create a New Environment File** 

For handling different environments like development, production, etc., Angular CLI provides a streamlined way to generate environment files. Use:



```bash
ng generate environment environment-name
```


This will create an environment configuration file that can hold variables such as API URLs or authentication keys.

### Conclusion 

Using Angular CLI commands, you can effectively organize your Angular application by following the `NgModule` structure, which ensures better maintainability and scalability. By utilizing these commands, you streamline your development process, creating a modular, well-structured application that adheres to best practices.
